        I'm a software developer who loves problem-solving and learning new skills. I transitioned to coding when I realised how much I enjoyed the programming aspect of my psychology research.
        <br />
        <br />
        With my background in psychology and people-focused job experiences, Iâ€™m a natural team player who cares about my peers and performs well in collaborative teams.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm currently seeking a role that will take advantage of my problem-solving skills, my team-player mentality, and my passion for coding.
